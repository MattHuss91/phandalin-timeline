bios = {'Llechan': "lechan's tribe of Tabaxi lived and worked in a quarrying community. One day, an ancient relic with magical essence was found whilst carving out a new cavern. The village wise men began to examine this, but accidentally unlocked dark magic that had been sealed within. This lead to the land being frozen overnight. Those who didn't die in these sudden conditions struggled to adapt to this new life. All those who had studied the relic were killed, and the relic itself was lost. From this, the rangers were born, a group of skilled survivalists who were sent out to try and find a way of reversing the curse. As far as he knows, Llechan is the last survivor of this group. He has become aware that the Dwarven Lords may have information concerning the type of magic used to freeze his land, therefore he has assigned himself to support the dwarves in any way he can, hoping that one day his deeds will earn him an audience with the lords, at which point he can make a request for information.", 'Ceridwen': '2 children, Creirwy (daughter) and Morfran (son). Creirwy is beautiful but Morfran is hideously ugly. ', 'Barry': 'Barry is not sure where he came from, or why he is here.

Born a weak goblin and frequently bullied by his peers. His life was turned around when he met the heroes of phandalin. Does to being the only living goblin from the Cragmar clan, Droop is now considered the King of Goblins. Which is a big step up from his humble start.', 'Nilsa Dendar': 'Born shortly before the fall of Thundertree, she remembers little of her home town. Having discovered the puzzle box and accidently opening it, she was given wild magical powers. She is slowly learnign to control them, and has prooved to be a valuable ally to the Heroes.

He was a powerful wizard and a cunning manipulator.  ', 'The Black Spider': 'The Black Spider is a shape-shifting changeling and master manipulator. Raised in a cruel drow orphanage, he was tormented by others until a series of mysterious murders (later revealed to be his own hidden actions) set him on a path of darkness. Discovering his true nature, he became obsessed with an ancient puzzle box said to contain the heart of a god. Through deception, seduction, and sorcery, he tricked others into unlocking it, causing devastation across the realm. Cold, calculating, and haunted by fragmented identities, the Black Spider walks the line between tragic victim and apocalyptic threat.', 'Taliesin': 'Taliesin is a mysterious and powerful figure tied deeply to Ceridwen’s past. Born from forbidden magic and raised in the shadows of secrets, he has become both a legend and a threat. Once a hopeful soul, his path diverged after learning of his origins; blending pain, purpose, and prophecy. Charismatic and cunning, Taliesin operates from the edges of conflict, manipulating events in pursuit of a fate only he seems to understand. Whether ally, enemy, or something in between, Taliesin remains a figure of unfinished business and untold consequences.', 'Aletha': 'A half Elf Rouge. She was determined to find a family relic in the town of Thundertree. Eventually her goal became her undoing. She was killed by the cultists of Venomfang', 'Venomfang': 'Venomfang is an ancient green dragon who once ruled the ruins of Thundertree with cruel amusement. Arrogant, sadistic, and supremely intelligent, he delights in psychological torment as much as physical domination. When the party encountered him, he toyed with them; offering a false head start so he could hunt them for sport. Though they ultimately escaped and later returned to face him, Venomfang’s presence left a scar of fear and fury. He is the embodiment of predatory pride: a force of nature that treats adventurers as entertainment, not threat.', 'Kadia': 'A trapped soul of a tabaxi. She could not pass to the otherside until the cursed diary was handed over to another. She was eventually able to pass when the party opened the diary and learnt the history of the spider', 'Icy Fire': 'Once a normal Tabaxi.

She is one of the few deities to offer compassion and hope to the drow, guiding those who wish to escape Lolth’s darkness and find a life of peace on the surface. Often appearing as a dancing, silver-haired woman under moonlight, Eilistraee teaches that joy, freedom, and kindness are sacred. Her followers often help lost souls, protect the innocent, and use music and dance as acts of divine expression. Though gentle, she is not weak — and when evil must be faced, her blade sings.', 'The Entiy of Rage': 'A being of pure range. one of multiple Entitiies the party have met on their travels', 'Corvin Blackthorn': 'A mysterious Human warlock bound to a forgotten power, Corvin walks the line between shadow and salvation.
